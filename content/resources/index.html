  There are many great migraine resources and lists that organisations and communities have created for migraine, but these are what has worked for me.

		What helped me the most was joining a community to talk about migraine. From small things like memes and how a can of coke can speed up the effects of triptans, to more significant conversations like how to come to terms with the idea that migraine might never get better, knowing there are others out there that have similar experiences has helped me a lot.

      Tracking migraine can help figure out triggers (what doesn't work) and find out what makes things better. Tracking triggers can be helpful to learning about your migraine and advocating with a doctor, but can be emotionally and physically draining, especially after an attack. Be kind to yourself.
      <a href="https://migrainebuddy.com/" target="_blank">Try the Migraine Buddy app</a> or create your own way to track.

    <h4 class="f4 mt4 lh-title">advocate for treatment</h4>

        alt="Simple representation of a grid layout overlayed in blue">
		Advocate for your treatment. Be direct and do not minimize your pain or symptoms. Write things down if it is hard to talk about with your doctor about your experiences. Bring someone you trust to help you get the care you need. Do research about possible treatments and medications. This is a labour, but it has helped me get the treatment and medication I needed. 
    Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wKPUeYMUVhtBJjFpKkl4u_2BAVJc7ccZA0dzObPo7S0/edit#gid=3" target="_blank">Common Migraine Medicine and Treatment List</a> from the r/migraine community.

		Knowing my body, what works and what does not work, has helped me get better treatment for myself, learn how to manage my symptoms better, and plan ahead. For example, I was terrified before I knew I had visual auras, and nobody believed me. Now that I know I get auras, I am calmer even though I don't understand why they happen.
