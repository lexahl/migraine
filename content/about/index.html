The parent company of GitHub is Microsoft, which holds a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the United States of America. The ICE enacts harmful and deeply racist acts of violence, including deportation and incarceration. My values are antithetical to this partnership and other perpetuations of violence and erasure committed against BIPOC communities.
