subtitle: "a chatbot for the conversation that I am too tired to have"

description: "I designed this chatbot to assist me with talking about my migraines. I've had migraines for more than 9 years now. They started when I was 15. I usually get a couple of migraines each week. I know you can't see my migraines, so I guess that it is hard to understand what they are like and how having migraines affects me.<br><br>"
